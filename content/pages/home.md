# Welcome!

Hi! My name's Igor and I'm a software developer who really enjoys coding and learning more and more about technology. I have developed this portal in order to create an enjoyable experience to anyone who'd like to know a few bits about me. Here are the main areas of the site:

### Home 👋

This is where you are, of course! This page is like a "map" of the site: here you can quickly get to know about each area of my domain! As of now
there aren't many, but as time passes, more sections will be added! Keep looking 👀!

### About me 🧐

In this section you can find a few bits and bytes about me such as who am I, some topics I really enjoy to study, how I became a software engineer and more curiosities! I guess this what you came looking for, right 🤣?

### Play 🦊

No time for reading? Not a problem! How about playing a quick top-down rpg-like game with my fox to get to know me a little better?
