# Welcome 👋!

Hello there, my name's Igor! Nice to meet you!

I'm a software developer who's passionate about programming and technology! I have developed this website in order to create an enjoyable experience to anyone who'd like to know a few bits about me or read my blog where I write about programming, technology and software engineering! Don't forget to check it out 🚀!

Peter, my virtual fox 🦊, also welcomes you! He's often around the website to help me out. You can interact with him directly on the game area! Give it a try 🕹️!

## Site Map 🗺️

### Home 🏠

You are here, of course! Here you can find a map of the site to know exactly where to go 👀!

### About 🧐

Here you will find a few bits about who I am, some topics I enjoy to study, how I became a software engineer and more curiosities! I guess this what you came looking for, right 🤣?

### Blog 📖

This is a place where I write about technology and share technical knowledge that might be useful to other people (and hopefully to you)! Why don't you check it out? I really hope you enjoy the content. Also, should you have anything to contribute to the posts, please, don't hesitate to open a pull-request on my Github repo [here](https://github.com/ipeternella/ipeternella.com) 🚀!

### Play 🦊

No time for reading? Not a problem! How about playing a quick top-down rpg-like game with Peter the fox to get to know me a little better? The game is still under construction 🚧 , but Peter is already there waiting for you!

## Thanks 🙏

Thanks a lot for spending some on my website! I hope you have enjoyed it a little bit! Feel free to contact me! See ya next time 👋!
