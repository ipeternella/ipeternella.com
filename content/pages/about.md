# About me

My career in software development started after I finished my undergraduate thesis at UNICAMP which was a project that included software engineering, chemical engineering and artificial intelligence. That project made me decide that I needed a career change and so I switched from chemical engineering to software engineering. Many years have passed since that fortunate decision and now I work as a software engineer!

### Curiosity

I've always been a self-taught person regarding things that I'm curious about! And that's definitely everything related to the computing world. Naturally, such characteristics lead me not only to study technologies, but also classic computing fundamentals. As a consequence, I really invest a lot of time learning the best software development practices, architectures and designs in terms of software engineering in order to create robust and production-ready solutions for real world problems. I truly believe that the combination of agile methodologies, well-tested/documented code and the focus on the final user experience to be essential for an application's success.

### Current studies

Despite having used many programming languages, some older ones — such as C, Lisp, SML — some newer ones — such as C#, JS, Ruby and GO — the language that I am most comfortable with and have most production experience is Python.

Nowadays, I invest my time in studying cloud providers and forms to optimize cloud architectures and resources. At work, I mostly use AWS and Azure whereas for personal projects I use GCP with Terraform for infra-as-code.

### Open-source projects

I really like open source projects! After work, I usually try to contribute and create such projects. So, please, check out my github! There one can find my open source projects such as games developed with Unity, Django servers, chat solutions, chat bots, OCR libraries and some algorithms and functional programming too!
