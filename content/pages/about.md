# About me

My career in software development started after I finished my undergraduate thesis at UNICAMP which was a project that included software engineering, chemical engineering and artificial intelligence. The software that I developed for that project made me decide that I needed a career change as I was amazed by the wonderful things that can be achieved in the computing world! Many years have passed since that fortunate decision and now I've been working as a software developer for more than 5 years.

### Curious Person

I've always been a self-taught person regarding things that I'm curious about! And that's definitely everything related to the computing world. I'm always looking for new technologies to learn and challenges/problems to solve! Computing is my passion so I always seek to acquire an in-depth knowledge of the systems that I work with specially the backend and infrastructure of such applications!

### Open-source projects

I really like open source projects! After work, I usually try to contribute and create such projects. So, please, check out my github! There one can find my open source projects such as games developed with Unity, Django servers, chat solutions, chat bots, and some algorithms using different programming languages!
