# 🦊 ipeternella.com 🏗️

A Gatsby and Phaser project design to anyone who would like to know a few bits about me. It features an interactive very short top-down rpg-like game with Peter the fox 🦊!

![website demonstration](docs/ipeternella.com.gif)

🚧 🏗️ This project is a WIP and as such many features of it are still missing and/or are experimental or may not yet be working properly. 🏗️ 🚧

## Objective

This project will (eventually) replace my [current website](https://ipeternella.com) with more modern front-end technologies and hopefully with an acceptable experience to anyone who'd like to know a little bit more about me. Some features are still to be defined.

## Graphics: disclaimer

All the sprites/graphics of the game have been created by me and no other artists' work have been used.

## Technologies (so far)

- React/Gatsby
- Phaser
- Styled Components
- Material UI
- Jest (Tests)
- Asesprite (sprites drawing)
- Tiled (map building)

## Tests

To run the test suite:

```sh
npm run test
```
